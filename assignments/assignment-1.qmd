# Assignment 1

My first assignment has 3 parts.

## (a)

It helps to autocomplete data and that's not like a static analysis.Most important thing to prioritize in development.R's tools are mature,sophisticated libraries for building kind of the foundational piece of what you would need for framework like shiny.

## (b)

1-Data structures: In R programming **c( )** function is used to create a vector.In Python, use the "\[\]" to create a vector.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 3, 4, 6, 3)
x
```

```{python}
vec_row = [1, 2, 3]
vec_row
```

2-Loops:

```{r}
for (i in 1:4) {
  print(i)
}
```

```{python}
for i in range(1, 4):
  print(i)
```

3-Data Types: In R; \<- used when assigning. In python; = used when assigning.

```{r}
y <- "nurgov"
y

```

```{r}
y = "nurgov"
y
```

## (c)

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data <- na_example
data
sum(is.na(data))

```

```{r}
new_data <- data
new_data[is.na(new_data)] <- 0
new_data
sum(is.na(new_data))
```
